# Shared > API Organization

## Why API Folder & what files will it consist of?
This folder will hold all the api files based on feature/endpoints(if feature is too extensive). These files will have the GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, etc calls to axios and will import api wrapper. These files will utilize the interfaces defined in shared > types folder.
